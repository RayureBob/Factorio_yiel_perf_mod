I found myself spending a lot of time on a spreadsheet while playing, only to calculate yield performances of my production lines.
So I started to make a mod about it.

The basic features are working.
Here's the todo list to completion:
• Add support for efficiency modules
• Add Support for productivity modules
• Extend UI to support recipe with more than 1 product (i.e. allow computation on chemical recipe like oil refining)
